# QuadTrees

Inital code from mike chambers can be found here: https://github.com/mikechambers/ExamplesByMesh/tree/master/JavaScript/QuadTree

Implemented the a bruteforce.html for the view of brute force and added text box for both bruteforce.html and quadtree.html to view the nuber of iterations being displayed.

Also added a pause and play button for both files for easier viewing.
